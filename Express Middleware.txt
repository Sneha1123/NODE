MIDDLEWARE:
are basically functions that have access to request and response objets and can do the following:
-execute any code
-make changes to request and response objects
-call the next middleware function in the stack


HOW MIDDLEWARE WORKS

app.use((req,res,next)=>{
  //console.log(Date.now());
  req.name='brad';  //can be accessed from anywhere in the application, from any route
  next(); //for next middleware to take place
});
